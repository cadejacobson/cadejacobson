# About Me
Hello! I am a senior at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology studying computer science. 
I am also incoming at Microsoft in Redmond, WA, where I will be a Software Engineer I for the Azure Linux team.
Along with this, I currently work at Property Meld as a Product and Development Intern (as a Dev and PM combo).
In the past, I spent two summers at Microsoft on the same Azure Linux team and one at Raven Industries in Sioux Falls, SD, as a Software Engineer Intern in the applied technology division.
I code mostly in C++ and Python, but have other professional experience doing web development and some Rust work.

For the best look at my work, take a look at my pinned Azure-Init repo. This is a live open source repo that I created in my first week at Microsoft and servedas my project for the Summer! 
This product is an agent that provisions VMs for Microsoft's cloud, Azure. It was written entirely in Rust for added security.

In my personal time, I have enjoyed working on lower level implementations of code. I have made a Python emulator of a CPU that first converted obj files to 
machine code in memory, and then ran assembly code from those instructions. Along with this, I have written a BASH-like shell in C that handles everything
from parallel commands, to piped input/output, to maintaining a command history while also tab completing input. These will be found in my repo soon, but were 
completed outside of GitHub and added afterwards.
