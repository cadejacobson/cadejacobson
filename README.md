# About Me
Hello! I am a third year at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology studying computer science. I am also currently interning at Microsoft in Redmond, WA, where I 
work on the Linux Provisioning Team. In the past, I interned at Raven Industries in Sioux Falls, SD, as a Software Engineer in the applied technology division.
I code mostly in C++ and Rust, but have other professional experience doing web development and some Python work.

For the best look at my work, take a look at my pinned Azure-Init repo. This is a live open source repo that I created in my first week at Microsoft and served
as my project for the Summer! This product is an agent that provisions VMs for Microsoft's cloud, Azure. It was written entirely in Rust for added security.
