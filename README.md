# About Me
Hello! I am a new graduate SWE for Microsoft Azure after graduating from South Dakota School of Mines and Technology.
During my time in college, I majored in computer science and minored in mathematics while earning the Summa Cum Laude title.
I had the pleasure of doing 5 internships in college at companies like [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) and [Raven Industries](https://www.ravenind.com/), totalling a total of 24 months of industry experience ranging from development to project management to webmaster.
This is paired with a nearly two year long undergraduate research role where I was the first author on one published machine learning paper, and a joint author on an actuator attack survey paper.
These positions can be seen more in-depth on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cadejacobson/).

For the best look at my work, take a look at my pinned [Azure-Init](https://github.com/Azure/azure-init/) repo. 
This is a live open source repo that I created in my first week at Microsoft and served as my project for the summer! 
This product is an agent that provisions VMs for Microsoft's cloud, Azure. 
It was written entirely in Rust for added security. 
In my personal time, I have enjoyed working on lower level implementations of code. I have made a Python emulator of a CPU that first converted obj files to 
machine code in memory, and then ran assembly code from those instructions. 
Along with this, I have written a BASH-like shell in C that handles everything
from parallel commands, to piped input/output, to maintaining a command history while also tab completing input. These will be found in my repo soon, but were 
completed outside of GitHub and added afterwards.
