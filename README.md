# About Me
Hello! I am a sophomore at South Dakota School of Mines and Technology studying computer science. I am also currently interning at Raven Industries in Sioux Falls, SD 
as a Software Engineer in the applied technology division. I code mostly in C++ as that is the primary language of instruction for my coursework, but here you
will also find some Python projects that I have taught myself. I have also started teaching myself HTML and CSS to be able to present my backend code in a more
pleasing way.

If you are interested in checking out my code, I would recommend the secondYearProjects repository. The prior independentProjects repository was a very poor 
representation of my git abilities, comment explanations, and general code quality. The repository will no longer be updated, and new coding practice can be found on
secondYearProjects. So far, I have added Leetcode solutions (along with their text explanations) and a few CSS demonstrations. I hope you enjoy!
